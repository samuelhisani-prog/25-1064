<p> 
Sport bikes have comparatively high-performance engines resting inside a lightweight frame. 
High tech and expensive materials are often used on sport bikes to reduce weight. 
Braking systems combine higher performance brake pads and disc brakes with multi-piston calipers that clamp onto oversized vented rotors.

<h2 class="center-text">Technologia</h2>
Key features include 
<h3>Full fairings for aerodynamics</h3>
<p>
Fairings are streamlined structures designed to reduce aerodynamic drag by smoothing out irregular surfaces, gaps, 
and protrusions on vehicles like aircraft and motorcycles.
Their primary function is to allow air to flow more smoothly over the vehicle's surface, minimizing turbulence and resistance.
By reducing drag, fairings improve fuel efficiency, increase speed, and enhance overall flight or riding performance.

<h3>Engines</br></h3>
<p>
These bikes typically have high-revving engines, often four-cylinder, though they come in various engine configurations including 
singles and twins.
The category is broad and includes subtypes like lightweight (under 500cc, ideal for beginners), middleweight (500ccâ€“800cc, 
often called supersport), and heavyweight or superbikes (1000cc and above), which are built for top speeds and track competition.
While sport bikes are highly capable, their aggressive ergonomics can be physically demanding for extended rides and wonderfull speeds

<h3>Body work and carbon fiber</h3>
<p>
Carbon fiber bodywork is a popular aftermarket upgrade for sport bikes, valued for its lightweight construction and 
high strength-to-weight ratio, which enhances performance and aerodynamics.These parts are designed to reduce unsprung weight, 
improving acceleration and handling.
</p>
<section>
<h3>Braking</h3>
<p>
Motorcycle braking systems are designed to convert kinetic energy into thermal energy through friction, with the front brake 
typically responsible for approximately 70% of the braking effort due to weight transfer during deceleration.
This front brake dominance is especially pronounced on sports bikes, which have a shorter wheelbase and more vertical fork geometry, 
allowing them to tolerate higher front braking load.

<h3 class="center-text">PRICING</h3>
<p>
New sport bikes generally cost between $8,000 and $22,000,influenced by engine size, performance, and brand.
